<h5>My Reflection</h5>
	<div>
Since this website is not a finished product i understand when all pointed out towards using pictures?
The people I asked are the real target users who are actually going to use this site and Iâ€™m glad that they liked the idea and helped me guiding what would attract them.
None of the users have tried to use the functional part so i got no feedback on its functionality.
